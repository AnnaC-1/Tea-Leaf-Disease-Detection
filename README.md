-Employed image processing and computer vision (PIL), deep learning frameworks designing CNN model 
architecture using the sequential API, and evaluating models using classification reports and confusion matrices
-Experienced in various aspects of deep learning, including dataset preprocessing, augmentation, handling 
techniques, training, and evaluating models with different layer types, regularization using dropout layers, 
and model compilation with the Adam optimizer
-Achieved overall accuracy of 84% while also demonstrating high precision, recall, and F1 scores accurately predicting accurate 
and reliable labels for a diverse set of samples
